I know PHP, some python -- I got it.

# Compiling & Running java

For some reason, you've gotta use the terminal to run & compile java files.

Maybe something to do with the interpreter / compiler distinction?


 ```
$ cd  [ path to file ie. ~/Desktop/Java ]

$ javac FileName.java
$ java FileName

 ```
